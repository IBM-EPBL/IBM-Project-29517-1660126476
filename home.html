<p class="para1">At 19, Rishabh Pant has gone through all the highs and lows of a cricketing career. A promising talent from Delhi, 
Pant came into reckoning after his exploits for India Under-19 in the 2016 World Cup. A dashing left-handed wicket-keeper batsman,
 he lit up the tournament with a blitzing 24-ball 75, the fastest half-century of the tournament, against Nepal and followed it up with a century against Namibia. 
India lost the title round - but came back with several positives - nothing bigger than the emergence of Pant. </p>
